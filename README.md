Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for taking the time to go through my solution.

Things I would improve with more time:
- make the backOneLevel functionality work
- add functionality to hide the 4 inputs while we enter the starting sentence so that it's not hardcoded
- add unit tests - I would use Jest

In order to run on a UNIX terminal:

```
yarn && yarn start
```
